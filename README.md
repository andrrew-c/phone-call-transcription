Transcribe recorded phone calls (before android removed this functionality)

## Background

I used to use an Android application called ACRCalls to record phone calls.  This was always for personal use.

The recordings have been sitting backed up for a long time, but I haven't done anything with it.  

This project is to transcribe the phone calls from `audio` to `text`.
